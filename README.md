## Welcome to BrewerSeth's FoundryVTT Module Pages

This page is set up to track the modules that I am currently running in my Rise of The Runelords Pathfinder 1E game using [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). The game in currently hosted on [Molten Hosting](https://moltenhosting.com/)

If your want to read up on my notes and tips for hosting FoundryVTT with [Molten Hosting](https://moltenhosting.com/) click here.

This list is mostly for me to track and organize the modules, but I have posted it public for anyone that might be interested. Shout out to [Bryans-Preferred-Modules-for-FoundryVTT](https://github.com/bryancasler/Bryans-Preferred-Modules-for-FoundryVTT) for being the inspiration for me to try to learn and track this on GitHub.
