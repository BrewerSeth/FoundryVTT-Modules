## Welcome to BrewerSeth's FoundryVTT Module Pages

This page is set up to track the modules that I am currently running in my Rise of The Runelords Pathfinder 1E game using [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). The game in currently hosted on [Molten Hosting](https://moltenhosting.com/)

If your want to read up on my notes and tips for hosting FoundryVTT with [Molten Hosting](https://moltenhosting.com/) click here.

This list is mostly for me to track and organize the modules, but I have posted it public for anyone that might be interested. Shout out to [Bryans-Preferred-Modules-for-FoundryVTT](https://github.com/bryancasler/Bryans-Preferred-Modules-for-FoundryVTT) for being the inspiration for me to try to learn and track this on GitHub.

## My Module Preferences

I prefer to use modules that are built with one purpose. I am not a big fan of all encompassing "Quality of Life Modules". I also prefer modules that have active development and support.

I also prefer modules that don't take a million hours to attempt to set up.

Finally,

## Active "Must Have" Modules

This is the list of modules that are currently installed and active on the server. This list will have a link to the resource page of the module and a short desription of what the module is.

#### Improvements for Everyone

| | Module | Description | Usage Notes  |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | Name | Description | Notes |
| :star: | [AutoComplete Whisper](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/autocomplete-whisper/) | Whisper quicker with typeahead autocomplete suggestions and popup menu of available whisper targets! | This really should be part of the core program. This simple does an auto suggestions when you are whispering messages to other players. |
| 11 | [Escape Window](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/escape-window) | Change the behavior of the ESC key from closing all windows to minimizing them. | Hitting the "ESC" key usually closes the window. I don't like that. So this module changes it to just minimize the window. |
| :star: | [Dice So Nice!](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice) | Adds animation of dice rolling across the screen. | (Notes) |
| 3 | [Ping](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pings/) | Players and GM can ping a location on the map | - Left Click to ping - Shift + Left Click to move everyone's view to your ping |
| 4 | [Chat Portrait](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/chat-portrait) | Notes | I like that this adds the portrait to the chat, but I really like that it can be configured to change the chat color and border to match the player color. This is a nice visual cue for the stream and makes it easy to scroll back on the chat and see what each player did. |
| 5 | [Quick Insert - Search Widget](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/quick-insert) | Notes | Usage Notes |
| :star: | [Zoom/Pan Options](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/zoom-pan-options) | Changes zooming and panning through the mouse or a touchpad. | When you scroll in on the mouse wheel, it centers on the mouse. Also allows for panning the scene using a swipe motion on multitouch trackpad. This is just how things should work. |
| 10 | [Turn Marker] | Notes | Shows an icon under the token whos current turn it is. Icon spins when the game is not paused. Announces in the chat what players turn it is. Also places a "ball marker" on the location where a token started the turn. |
| 11 | [Chat Images](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/chat-images) | Notes | Usage Notes |

#### Improvements for Journals and World Building

| | Module | Description | Usage Notes  |
| - | - | - | - |
| 6 | [Monk's Enhanced Journal](https://github.com/ironmonk88/monks-enhanced-journal) | Notes | Usage Notes |
| 9 | [Show Notes](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundryvtt-show-notes) | Journal notes show on the map without having to have your players turn it on themselves. | This works well as long as you don't have a lot of clutter on the maps. This still honors the visibility of the journal entry, unfortunately there isn't a visual indicator on the map on what players can see. You can toggle visibility by clicking the icon and changing the visibility state. If a player doesn't have access to the journal, they can't see the map note. I use this for the landing page. |

#### Streaming and Game Recording Modules

| | Module | Description | Usage Notes  |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | [Stream View](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/stream-view) | Provides a minimal UI view with automated camera work. | This is a must have for streaming. To set this up, you create an "Observer" ghost player. This module then cleans up the UI for that player and automatically moves the camera around for that player. I uses this view to record/stream the game sessions with OBS. The camera is set to automatically follow the action. |

## Archived or Retired Modules

A list of modules that I am no longer using and why.

- Show Drag Distance - I will look into this later, but I think this can be solved with the tools in the core.
- Argon Combat HUD - Neat but more 5e centered
- Combat Ready! - I like this, but the same result is achieved with Turn Marker and that module is a bit more visually appealing for the stream.
